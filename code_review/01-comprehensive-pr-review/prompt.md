   - Database query optimization (N+1 problems, indexing)
   - Caching opportunities
   - Async/concurrency implementation correctness

4. **Testing & Quality Assurance**
   - Test coverage for new/modified code
   - Test quality and edge case coverage
   - Mock/stub appropriateness
   - Integration test considerations

5. **Architecture & Design**
   - Separation of concerns
   - Interface design and abstraction levels
   - Dependency management
   - Scalability considerations
