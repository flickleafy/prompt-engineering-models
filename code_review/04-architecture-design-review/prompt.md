# Architectural Review Framework

## 1. SOLID Principles Compliance

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- [ ] Each class/module has one reason to change
- [ ] Functions do one thing well
- [ ] No "god classes" or "god functions"

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- [ ] Code open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] Use of interfaces and abstractions
- [ ] Plugin/strategy patterns where appropriate

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- [ ] Subtypes properly substitutable for base types
- [ ] No contract violations in inheritance
- [ ] Interface segregation respected

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- [ ] No fat interfaces forcing unnecessary implementations
- [ ] Clients depend only on methods they use
- [ ] Role-based interfaces

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- [ ] High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- [ ] Both depend on abstractions
- [ ] Dependency injection used appropriately

## 2. Design Patterns Analysis
Evaluate appropriate use of design patterns:
- [ ] **Creational**: Factory, Builder, Singleton usage
- [ ] **Structural**: Adapter, Facade, Proxy, Decorator
- [ ] **Behavioral**: Strategy, Observer, Command, Template Method
- [ ] Patterns used appropriately (not over-engineered)
- [ ] No anti-patterns introduced

## 3. Clean Architecture / Layered Architecture
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Dependencies point inward (toward domain)
- [ ] Business logic independent of frameworks
- [ ] Database/external services abstracted
- [ ] Domain models protected from infrastructure concerns

## 4. Modularity & Coupling
- [ ] Low coupling between modules
- [ ] High cohesion within modules
- [ ] Clear module boundaries
- [ ] Minimal circular dependencies
- [ ] Appropriate abstraction levels

## 5. Scalability & Extensibility
- [ ] Design scales horizontally
- [ ] Stateless where possible
- [ ] Easy to add new features
- [ ] Configuration-driven behavior
- [ ] Future-proofing without over-engineering

## 6. Data Flow & State Management
- [ ] Clear data flow patterns
- [ ] Immutability where appropriate
- [ ] State changes controlled and predictable
- [ ] Event sourcing/CQRS if applicable
- [ ] Transaction boundaries well-defined

## 7. Error Handling Strategy
- [ ] Consistent error handling approach
- [ ] Appropriate use of exceptions vs. error returns
- [ ] Error recovery strategies
- [ ] Fail-fast vs. resilient approaches
- [ ] Circuit breaker patterns where needed

## 8. Testing Strategy
- [ ] Testable architecture
- [ ] Appropriate use of mocks/stubs
- [ ] Test pyramid adherence
- [ ] Integration testing feasibility

**Flexibility**: [Score/10]

### Executive Summary
[2-3 sentences on overall architectural soundness]

## Critical Design Issues (ðŸ”´ Architecture Smells)
### Issue: [Title]
- **Pattern**: [Anti-pattern or smell detected]
- **Location**: [File/Module]
- **Impact**: [Long-term consequences]
- **Refactoring Required**: [Specific architectural changes needed]
- **Estimated Effort**: [Small/Medium/Large refactor]

## Significant Design Concerns (ðŸŸ¡)
[Design issues that impact maintainability but not blockers]

## Design Improvement Opportunities (ðŸ”µ)
[Refactoring suggestions that would improve the design]

## Positive Design Decisions (âœ…)
[Good architectural choices worth highlighting]

## Technical Debt Assessment
**New Technical Debt Introduced**: [High/Medium/Low/None]
**Technical Debt Paid Down**: [Description of improvements]
**Net Technical Debt**: [Overall impact]

## Dependency Analysis

New Dependencies:
- [Package Name] - [Purpose] - [Concern Level: Low/Medium/High]

Dependency Graph Impact:
- [Circular dependencies introduced?]
- [Coupling increased/decreased?]

## Future-Proofing Analysis
- [ ] Easy to adapt to requirement changes
- [ ] Can accommodate new features without major rewrites
- [ ] Migration path clear if needed
- [ ] API versioning strategy considered

## Refactoring Recommendations
1. **Priority 1 (Do Now)**: [Critical refactoring needed]
2. **Priority 2 (Next Sprint)**: [Important improvements]
3. **Priority 3 (Backlog)**: [Nice-to-have refactoring]

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) Needed
- [ ] Document why this approach was chosen
- [ ] Record trade-offs made
- [ ] Note alternatives considered

## Approval Status
- [ ] âœ… Architecturally sound
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Acceptable with noted concerns
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Requires architectural changes

**Review Confidence**: [High/Medium/Low]
