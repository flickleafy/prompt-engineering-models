## Backend JavaScript Review Criteria

### 1. Node.js Core Modules

- [ ] Proper use of core modules (fs, path, http, etc.)
- [ ] Buffer handling for binary data
- [ ] Stream usage for large data processing
- [ ] Event emitter patterns
- [ ] Process and child_process management
- [ ] Module caching awareness

### 2. Asynchronous Patterns

- [ ] Callback pattern (legacy code)
- [ ] Error-first callback convention
- [ ] Avoiding callback hell
- [ ] Proper error propagation
- [ ] Event loop understanding
- [ ] Non-blocking I/O operations

### 3. Error Handling

- [ ] Try-catch for synchronous code
- [ ] Error handling in callbacks
- [ ] Unhandled rejection handling
- [ ] Uncaught exception handling
- [ ] Custom error classes
- [ ] Proper error logging
- [ ] Graceful shutdown on fatal errors

### 4. Security Considerations

- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] SQL/NoSQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection
- [ ] CSRF protection mechanisms
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Secure session management
- [ ] Environment variable usage for secrets

### 5. Performance and Scalability

- [ ] Memory leak prevention
- [ ] CPU-intensive task handling
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Caching strategies
- [ ] Efficient data structures
- [ ] Avoiding synchronous operations
- [ ] Load balancing considerations

### 6. API Design

- [ ] RESTful principles
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Request/response validation
- [ ] Error response structure
- [ ] API versioning
- [ ] Pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Content negotiation

### 7. Database Interactions

- [ ] Connection management
- [ ] Query optimization
- [ ] Transaction handling
- [ ] Data validation before persistence
- [ ] Avoiding N+1 queries
- [ ] Proper indexing considerations

### 8. File System Operations

- [ ] Async file operations
- [ ] Path traversal prevention
- [ ] File upload handling
- [ ] Stream usage for large files
- [ ] Proper file cleanup
- [ ] Temporary file management

### 9. Logging and Monitoring

- [ ] Structured logging
- [ ] Appropriate log levels
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs
- [ ] Request/response logging
- [ ] Error tracking
- [ ] Performance monitoring hooks

### 10. Code Organization

- [ ] Module pattern for encapsulation
- [ ] Separation of concerns
- [ ] Configuration management
- [ ] Environment-specific settings
- [ ] Dependency injection patterns
