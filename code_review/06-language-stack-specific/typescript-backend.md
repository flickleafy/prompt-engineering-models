## TypeScript Backend Review Criteria

### 1. Type Safety in Backend Context

- [ ] Proper types for request/response objects
- [ ] Database model type definitions
- [ ] API endpoint type contracts
- [ ] Environment variable types
- [ ] Configuration type safety
- [ ] DTO (Data Transfer Object) types
- [ ] Error types and error handling

### 2. TypeScript-Specific Backend Patterns

- [ ] Generic types for repository patterns
- [ ] Type guards for runtime validation
- [ ] Discriminated unions for request/response variants
- [ ] Utility types for API contracts
- [ ] Type-safe middleware chains
- [ ] Branded types for domain primitives
- [ ] Conditional types for polymorphic handlers

### 3. Node.js Type Integration

- [ ] Proper @types packages installed
- [ ] Node.js core module type imports
- [ ] Express/Fastify/Nest type definitions
- [ ] Database driver type packages
- [ ] Type-safe environment variables
- [ ] Event emitter types

### 4. API Type Safety

- [ ] Request body/query/params types
- [ ] Response type definitions
- [ ] Middleware type signatures
- [ ] Route handler type safety
- [ ] Validation schema types (Zod, Joi, etc.)
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger type generation

### 5. Database and ORM Types

- [ ] TypeORM/Prisma/Sequelize entity types
- [ ] Query result types
- [ ] Migration type safety
- [ ] Repository pattern with generics
- [ ] Transaction types
- [ ] Connection pool types

### 6. Async/Await Type Safety

- [ ] Promise return types
- [ ] Async function signatures
- [ ] Error types in try-catch
- [ ] Type-safe error handlers
- [ ] Async middleware types

### 7. Dependency Injection

- [ ] Constructor parameter types
- [ ] Service container types
- [ ] Interface-based abstractions
- [ ] Provider type definitions
- [ ] Injection token types

### 8. Configuration and Environment

- [ ] Type-safe config objects
- [ ] Environment variable validation
- [ ] Feature flags with literal types
- [ ] Configuration schema types
- [ ] Settings validation at startup

### 9. Error Handling

- [ ] Custom error class hierarchy with types
- [ ] Error union types
- [ ] Type-safe error middleware
- [ ] Domain-specific error types
- [ ] Result/Either type patterns

### 10. Security with Types

- [ ] Type-safe authentication payloads
- [ ] Authorization role types
- [ ] JWT payload types
- [ ] Session data types
- [ ] Sanitization with type preservation

### 11. Testing Types

- [ ] Test fixture types
- [ ] Mock types
- [ ] Stub return types
- [ ] Test data builder types
- [ ] Type-safe test assertions

### 12. Performance and Scalability

- [ ] Type-safe worker thread messages
- [ ] Stream types
- [ ] Buffer handling with types
- [ ] Cache key/value types
- [ ] Queue message types

### 13. Code Organization

- [ ] Barrel exports with types
- [ ] Layered architecture type boundaries
- [ ] Domain model types
- [ ] Application service types
- [ ] Infrastructure layer types

### 14. TypeScript Configuration

- [ ] Strict mode enabled
- [ ] Proper target and module settings
- [ ] Path aliases configured
- [ ] Declaration file generation
- [ ] Source maps for debugging
- [ ] Incremental compilation

### 15. Common Backend TypeScript Pitfalls

- [ ] Excessive use of `any` in third-party integrations
- [ ] Missing types for external data
- [ ] Type assertions bypassing validation
- [ ] Incomplete error type coverage
- [ ] Improper async type handling
