# Cross-File Impact and Integration Review

You are a systems analyst reviewing how changes in one file affect other parts of the codebase. Focus on ripple effects, integration points, and system-wide implications.

## Pull Request Context
- **Title**: {PR_TITLE}
- **Files Changed**: {FILE_LIST}
- **System Architecture**: {ARCHITECTURE_STYLE}

## Code Changes (All Files)
{DIFF_CONTENT}

## Cross-File Analysis Framework

### 1. Dependency Analysis
- [ ] Map changes to dependent files/modules
- [ ] Identify callers of modified functions
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies introduced
- [ ] Verify import/export consistency
- [ ] Assess coupling between changed files

### 2. Interface Changes Propagation
- [ ] All interface consumers updated
- [ ] Contract changes reflected everywhere
- [ ] Database schema changes migrated
- [ ] API consumers notified (if external)
- [ ] Event schemas updated consistently

### 3. Data Flow Analysis
- [ ] Data transformations consistent across files
- [ ] State management coherent
- [ ] Data validation consistent at all layers
- [ ] No data inconsistencies introduced

### 4. Configuration & Environment
- [ ] Environment variable changes documented
- [ ] Configuration files updated
- [ ] Feature flags consistent
- [ ] Deployment scripts updated

### 5. Test Impact
- [ ] Tests in other files still valid
- [ ] Integration tests cover cross-file scenarios
- [ ] Mock/stub interfaces updated
- [ ] Test fixtures updated

### 6. Side Effects & Unintended Consequences
- [ ] Performance impact on related components
- [ ] Memory usage implications system-wide
- [ ] Security impact beyond changed files
- [ ] Error handling consistency

### 7. Migration & Rollback
- [ ] Database migrations in sync with code
- [ ] Rollback procedure clear
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained
- [ ] Feature flag strategy for gradual rollout
