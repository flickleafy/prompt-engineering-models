# Security Review Framework (STRIDE + OWASP)

Analyze the code through these security lenses:

## 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Proper authentication mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Authorization checks at appropriate layers
- [ ] Session management security
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication considerations
- [ ] Token expiration and rotation
- [ ] Privilege escalation prevention

## 2. Input Validation & Data Sanitization
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] Whitelist validation over blacklist
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
- [ ] XSS prevention (output encoding)
- [ ] Command injection prevention
- [ ] Path traversal protection
- [ ] File upload validation (type, size, content)

## 3. Sensitive Data Protection
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] Encryption for sensitive data at rest
- [ ] TLS/SSL for data in transit
- [ ] Secure password hashing (bcrypt, Argon2)
- [ ] PII handling compliance (GDPR, CCPA)
- [ ] Secure logging (no sensitive data in logs)
- [ ] Memory handling for sensitive data

## 4. API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting implementation
- [ ] CORS configuration security
- [ ] API versioning and deprecation
- [ ] Request size limits
- [ ] Timeout configurations
- [ ] Error message information disclosure

## 5. Dependency & Supply Chain Security
- [ ] No vulnerable dependencies introduced
- [ ] Dependencies from trusted sources
- [ ] Minimal dependency footprint
- [ ] License compatibility
- [ ] Transitive dependency security

## 6. Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] No sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] Proper exception handling
- [ ] Secure logging practices
- [ ] Audit trail for security-relevant events
- [ ] Log injection prevention

## 7. Cryptography
- [ ] Industry-standard algorithms (AES-256, RSA-2048+)
- [ ] No custom/weak cryptography
- [ ] Proper key management
- [ ] Secure random number generation
- [ ] Certificate validation

## 8. Business Logic Security
- [ ] Race condition prevention
- [ ] Transaction integrity
- [ ] Resource exhaustion protection
- [ ] Logic flaws that could be exploited
