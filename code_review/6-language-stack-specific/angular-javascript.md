## Angular JavaScript Review Criteria

### 1. Module Organization
- [ ] Proper module declaration and dependencies
- [ ] Module naming conventions
- [ ] Module structure (features, core, shared)
- [ ] Dependency injection configuration
- [ ] Module loading order

### 2. Controllers
- [ ] Controller naming (PascalCase with Controller suffix)
- [ ] Avoid fat controllers (logic in services)
- [ ] `$scope` usage patterns
- [ ] `controllerAs` syntax preference
- [ ] Controller initialization logic
- [ ] Avoiding `$scope.$watch` overuse

### 3. Services and Factories
- [ ] Service vs. Factory vs. Provider choice
- [ ] Singleton pattern understanding
- [ ] Service naming conventions
- [ ] Business logic encapsulation
- [ ] Dependency injection
- [ ] Service return values

### 4. Directives
- [ ] Directive naming (camelCase)
- [ ] Restrict options (E, A, C, M)
- [ ] Isolated scope usage
- [ ] Link function implementation
- [ ] Template vs. templateUrl
- [ ] Directive reusability
- [ ] `bindToController` usage

### 5. Dependency Injection
- [ ] Array notation for minification safety
- [ ] `$inject` annotation
- [ ] Inline array annotation
- [ ] Proper service injection
- [ ] Avoiding global scope pollution

### 6. Scope Management
- [ ] Understanding scope hierarchy
- [ ] `$scope` vs. `controllerAs`
- [ ] Scope inheritance patterns
- [ ] Avoiding scope soup
- [ ] Event broadcasting ($emit, $broadcast)
- [ ] Scope destruction cleanup

### 7. Data Binding
- [ ] Two-way binding usage (`ng-model`)
- [ ] One-way binding where appropriate
- [ ] Expression simplicity in templates
- [ ] Avoiding complex filters in bindings
- [ ] Binding performance considerations

### 8. Digest Cycle Awareness
- [ ] Understanding `$apply`, `$digest`
- [ ] Avoiding digest cycle triggers in loops
- [ ] `$timeout` vs. `setTimeout`
- [ ] Performance implications of watchers
- [ ] Minimizing `$watch` usage

### 9. Promises and Async
- [ ] `$q` promise service usage
- [ ] Promise chaining
- [ ] Error handling in promises
- [ ] `$http` service patterns
- [ ] Avoiding callback hell

### 10. Templates and Views
- [ ] `ng-if` vs. `ng-show/ng-hide`
- [ ] `ng-repeat` with track by
- [ ] Template organization
- [ ] Avoiding logic in templates
- [ ] Proper use of filters

### 11. Routing
- [ ] `ngRoute` or `ui-router` configuration
- [ ] Route definitions
- [ ] Resolve blocks for data loading
- [ ] Route parameters
- [ ] Navigation guards

### 12. Forms and Validation
- [ ] Form controller usage
- [ ] `ng-model` binding
- [ ] Built-in validators
- [ ] Custom validators
- [ ] Form submission handling
- [ ] Validation feedback

### 13. Performance Optimization
- [ ] One-time binding (::) for static data
- [ ] `track by` in `ng-repeat`
- [ ] Debouncing on `ng-model`
- [ ] Minimizing watchers
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for large lists
- [ ] Pagination strategies

### 14. Testing Patterns
- [ ] Unit test structure
- [ ] Mocking dependencies
- [ ] `$httpBackend` for HTTP testing
- [ ] Directive testing
- [ ] End-to-end test patterns

### 15. Best Practices
- [ ] Avoiding jQuery (use jqLite)
- [ ] Using AngularJS services over globals
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Logging with `$log`
- [ ] Configuration vs. run blocks

### 16. Common AngularJS Pitfalls
- [ ] Scope inheritance issues
- [ ] Digest cycle performance
- [ ] Memory leaks from watchers
- [ ] Direct DOM manipulation
- [ ] Mixing jQuery and Angular
