## React Functional/Hooks TypeScript Review Criteria

### 1. TypeScript Integration
- [ ] Proper component type annotations
- [ ] `React.FC` vs. function component typing
- [ ] Props interface definitions
- [ ] Generic components with type parameters
- [ ] Event handler types (`React.MouseEvent`, etc.)
- [ ] Ref types (`React.RefObject`, `React.MutableRefObject`)
- [ ] Children type (`React.ReactNode`, `React.ReactElement`)

### 2. Props and State Types
- [ ] Interface vs. type for props
- [ ] Optional vs. required props
- [ ] Readonly props where appropriate
- [ ] Union types for prop variants
- [ ] Discriminated unions for polymorphic components
- [ ] Generic props for reusable components
- [ ] Default props typing

### 3. Hooks with TypeScript
- [ ] `useState` with type inference or explicit typing
- [ ] `useEffect` dependency array typing
- [ ] `useContext` with typed context
- [ ] `useReducer` with typed state and actions
- [ ] `useCallback` with proper function signatures
- [ ] `useMemo` with return type inference
- [ ] `useRef` with appropriate ref types
- [ ] Custom hooks with proper type signatures

### 4. Component Structure
- [ ] Functional components over class components
- [ ] Proper component naming (PascalCase)
- [ ] Single responsibility per component
- [ ] Component composition patterns
- [ ] Custom hook extraction with types
- [ ] Type-safe component interfaces

### 5. Event Handling Types
- [ ] Typed event handlers
- [ ] `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`
- [ ] `React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>`
- [ ] `React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`
- [ ] Synthetic event types
- [ ] Custom event handler types

### 6. Context API with Types
- [ ] Typed context creation
- [ ] Context value interface
- [ ] Type-safe context consumer
- [ ] Generic context patterns
- [ ] Context with undefined initial value
- [ ] Provider props typing

### 7. Refs with TypeScript
- [ ] `useRef<HTMLElement | null>(null)`
- [ ] `forwardRef` with proper typing
- [ ] Imperative handle types
- [ ] Callback ref typing
- [ ] Ref forwarding in generic components

### 8. Forms with TypeScript
- [ ] Controlled input types
- [ ] Form state interface
- [ ] Validation error types
- [ ] Form submission handler types
- [ ] Form library integration types (Formik, React Hook Form)

### 9. Children Patterns
- [ ] `React.ReactNode` for general children
- [ ] `React.ReactElement` for specific elements
- [ ] Render props with type parameters
- [ ] Compound component patterns
- [ ] Children as function pattern

### 10. Higher-Order Components (HOCs)
- [ ] Generic HOC type definitions
- [ ] Props injection typing
- [ ] Type inference in HOCs
- [ ] Component type preservation

### 11. Render Props
- [ ] Type-safe render prop patterns
- [ ] Function children typing
- [ ] Render prop return types

### 12. Performance Optimization
- [ ] `React.memo` with typed comparison function
- [ ] `useMemo` type inference
- [ ] `useCallback` type preservation
- [ ] Proper key props in lists
- [ ] Lazy loading with `React.lazy`
- [ ] Code splitting strategies

### 13. Error Boundaries
- [ ] Error boundary type definitions
- [ ] Error state typing
- [ ] Fallback component props

### 14. Third-Party Libraries
- [ ] Proper `@types` packages installed
- [ ] Typed library integrations
- [ ] Type-safe API calls
- [ ] Redux/Zustand state typing (if applicable)

### 15. Advanced TypeScript Patterns
- [ ] Discriminated unions for component variants
- [ ] Mapped types for dynamic props
- [ ] Conditional types in components
- [ ] Utility types (Omit, Pick, Partial, etc.)
- [ ] Type guards in components
- [ ] Template literal types for variants

### 16. Common TypeScript React Pitfalls
- [ ] Avoiding `any` type in components
- [ ] Proper null/undefined handling
- [ ] Type assertion overuse
- [ ] Event type mismatches
- [ ] Implicit children typing issues
- [ ] Generic component constraints
