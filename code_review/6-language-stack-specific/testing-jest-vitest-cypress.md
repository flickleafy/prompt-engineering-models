## Testing Review Criteria

### 1. Test Structure and Organization
- [ ] Test file naming conventions (`*.test.js`, `*.spec.js`)
- [ ] Test file location (co-located or separate directory)
- [ ] Describe block organization
- [ ] Test grouping by feature/component
- [ ] Logical test ordering
- [ ] Test file modularity
- [ ] Nested describe blocks appropriateness

### 2. Test Naming and Readability
- [ ] Descriptive test names (`it('should...')` or `test('...')`)
- [ ] Clear test intent
- [ ] Given-When-Then structure
- [ ] Readable assertions
- [ ] Avoiding abbreviations
- [ ] Consistent naming patterns

### 3. Test Independence
- [ ] Each test runs independently
- [ ] No shared state between tests
- [ ] Proper setup and teardown
- [ ] No test execution order dependencies
- [ ] Isolated test data
- [ ] Avoiding side effects

### 4. Setup and Teardown (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] `beforeEach` and `afterEach` usage
- [ ] `beforeAll` and `afterAll` when appropriate
- [ ] Cleanup in teardown hooks
- [ ] Test isolation
- [ ] Database/state reset
- [ ] Mock cleanup

### 5. Assertions (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] Appropriate matcher usage
- [ ] Single assertion per test (or related assertions)
- [ ] `expect()` assertions
- [ ] Custom matchers when beneficial
- [ ] Negative assertions
- [ ] Async assertion handling
- [ ] Snapshot testing appropriateness

### 6. Mocking and Stubbing (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] `jest.mock()` or `vi.mock()` usage
- [ ] Mock function creation
- [ ] Spy usage (`jest.spyOn()`, `vi.spyOn()`)
- [ ] Mock implementation
- [ ] Mock restore/cleanup
- [ ] Partial mocking
- [ ] Module mocking patterns

### 7. Async Testing (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] Async/await patterns
- [ ] Promise handling
- [ ] `done` callback (when appropriate)
- [ ] Timeout configuration
- [ ] Error handling in async tests
- [ ] Race condition prevention
- [ ] Async assertion patterns

### 8. Snapshot Testing (Jest/Vitest)
- [ ] Appropriate snapshot usage
- [ ] Snapshot size management

- [ ] Snapshot review process

### 9. Test Coverage
- [ ] Critical path coverage
- [ ] Edge case testing
- [ ] Error scenario coverage
- [ ] Branch coverage
- [ ] Happy path and sad path tests
- [ ] Coverage thresholds
- [ ] Untested code identification

### 10. E2E Testing (Cypress)
- [ ] Test organization in Cypress
- [ ] Spec file structure
- [ ] Command usage
- [ ] Custom commands
- [ ] Fixture usage
- [ ] Intercept/route handling
- [ ] Viewport configuration

### 11. Cypress Selectors
- [ ] Data attribute selectors (`data-cy`, `data-test`)
- [ ] Avoiding fragile selectors (classes, IDs)
- [ ] Semantic selector usage
- [ ] Custom selector commands
- [ ] Selector best practices
- [ ] Accessibility-based selectors

### 12. Cypress Assertions
- [ ] Should assertions
- [ ] Expect assertions
- [ ] Implicit vs explicit assertions
- [ ] Retry-ability awareness
- [ ] Negative assertions
- [ ] Custom assertions
- [ ] Multiple assertions chaining

### 13. Cypress Commands and Actions
- [ ] `cy.get()`, `cy.contains()` usage
- [ ] `cy.visit()` patterns
- [ ] `cy.click()`, `cy.type()` actions
- [ ] `cy.wait()` usage (avoiding fixed waits)
- [ ] `cy.intercept()` for API mocking
- [ ] `cy.request()` for API calls
- [ ] Custom command implementation

### 14. Test Data Management
- [ ] Fixture files (Cypress)
- [ ] Test data factories
- [ ] Test data cleanup
- [ ] Database seeding
- [ ] Random data generation
- [ ] Data-driven testing
- [ ] Test data isolation

### 15. Integration Testing
- [ ] API integration tests
- [ ] Database integration tests
- [ ] Component integration tests
- [ ] Service layer tests
- [ ] Module integration
- [ ] External service mocking
- [ ] Contract testing

### 16. Component Testing (React/Vue/Angular)
- [ ] Component mounting (Testing Library, Enzyme)
- [ ] Props testing
- [ ] Event testing
- [ ] State testing
- [ ] Hook testing
- [ ] Lifecycle testing
- [ ] Accessibility testing

### 17. Test Performance
- [ ] Test execution speed
- [ ] Parallel test execution
- [ ] Test timeout configuration
- [ ] Expensive operation avoidance
- [ ] Database interaction optimization
- [ ] Mock usage for speed
- [ ] CI/CD optimization

### 18. Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Exception testing
