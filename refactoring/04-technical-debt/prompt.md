- **Codebase Size**: {LOC_COUNT} lines
- **Age**: {PROJECT_AGE}
- **Technology Stack**: {TECH_STACK}
- **Team Size**: {TEAM_SIZE}

# Analysis Instructions
Conduct comprehensive technical debt analysis across these categories:

## 1. **Code Debt**

### Indicators:
- **Code Smells**: Duplicated code, long methods, god classes
- **Complexity**: High cyclomatic complexity (>10), deep nesting (>4 levels)
- **Dead Code**: Unused functions, commented-out code, orphaned files
- **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded values without constants
- **Poor Naming**: Unclear variable/function names
- **Missing Abstractions**: Primitive obsession, feature envy

### Metrics to Calculate:
- Cyclomatic complexity per method/class
- Code duplication percentage
- Lines of code per method/class
- Comment-to-code ratio
- Dead code percentage

## 2. **Design Debt**

### Indicators:
- **Architectural Violations**: Breaking layer boundaries
- **Tight Coupling**: High fan-in/fan-out, circular dependencies
- **Low Cohesion**: Classes with unrelated responsibilities
- **SOLID Violations**: SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP breaches
- **Missing Patterns**: Opportunities for proven design patterns
- **Monolithic Structure**: Lack of modularity

### Metrics to Calculate:
- Coupling metrics (afferent/efferent coupling)
- Cohesion metrics (LCOM - Lack of Cohesion of Methods)
- Dependency graph complexity
- Architecture compliance score

## 3. **Testing Debt**

### Indicators:
- **Low Coverage**: <80% code coverage
- **Missing Tests**: Untested critical paths, edge cases
- **Flaky Tests**: Tests that randomly fail
- **Slow Tests**: Test suites taking >10 minutes
- **Poor Test Quality**: Tests without assertions, testing internals
- **Missing Test Types**: Lack of integration, E2E, performance tests

### Metrics to Calculate:
- Code coverage percentage (line, branch, path)
- Test execution time
- Flaky test ratio
- Assertion density
- Test-to-code ratio

## 4. **Documentation Debt**

### Indicators:
- **Missing Documentation**: No README, API docs, architecture diagrams
- **Outdated Documentation**: Docs not matching current code
- **Undocumented APIs**: Public methods without docstrings
- **Missing Examples**: No usage examples, tutorials
- **Poor Comments**: Misleading or redundant comments
- **No Onboarding Docs**: New developer setup guides missing

### Metrics to Calculate:
- Documentation coverage (public APIs documented)
- Documentation freshness (last updated date)
- Comment density
- README completeness score

## 5. **Infrastructure Debt**

### Indicators:
- **Outdated Dependencies**: Libraries with known vulnerabilities
- **Manual Processes**: No CI/CD, manual deployment
- **Missing Automation**: No linting, formatting, security scanning
- **Configuration Drift**: Inconsistent environments
- **No Monitoring**: Missing logs, metrics, alerting
- **Scalability Issues**: Hard-coded limits, single points of failure

### Metrics to Calculate:
- Dependency age (days since last update)
- Security vulnerabilities count (CVE)
- Automation coverage (build, test, deploy)
- Infrastructure as Code percentage

## 6. **Performance Debt**

### Indicators:
- **Algorithmic Issues**: O(nÂ²) where O(n) possible
- **Memory Leaks**: Unreleased resources
- **Database Issues**: N+1 queries, missing indexes
- **No Caching**: Repeated expensive computations
- **Blocking Operations**: Sync operations where async appropriate
- **Resource Waste**: Inefficient data structures

### Metrics to Calculate:
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Memory usage trends
- Database query performance
- CPU utilization
- API call efficiency

- [ ] Business impact includes concrete numbers (velocity, incidents, costs)
- [ ] Remediation plans are detailed and actionable
- [ ] ROI calculations justify prioritization decisions
- [ ] Quick wins are identified for immediate value
- [ ] Critical debt items are flagged with urgency indicators

# Meta-Prompting Guidelines

<reasoning_effort>
Use HIGH reasoning effort for technical debt analysis requiring complex tradeoff analysis, cost-benefit calculations, and strategic planning.
</reasoning_effort>

<self_reflection>
- Create rubric: debt identification completeness, impact quantification accuracy, remediation feasibility, ROI calculation validity, prioritization logic
- Ensure recommendations are pragmatic and achievable
- Verify that quick wins are truly quick and impactful
- Check that critical debt justification is data-driven
</self_reflection>

<exploration>
- Analyze codebase metrics and trends over time
- Consider team capacity and skill levels
- Evaluate business priorities and constraints
- Research industry benchmarks for comparison
- Identify systemic issues causing debt accumulation
</exploration>

<persistence>
- Calculate debt metrics comprehensively
- Don't skip quantification even when difficult
- Research standard debt measurement techniques
- Provide actionable roadmap, not just problem list
</persistence>
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Start with Metrics**: Establish baseline measurements before refactoring
2. **Prioritize by ROI**: Focus on high-impact, low-effort items first
3. **Track Progress**: Monitor debt metrics over time
4. **Allocate Capacity**: Reserve 20% of sprint capacity for debt reduction
5. **Prevent New Debt**: Implement quality gates to prevent debt accumulation
6. **Communicate Value**: Translate technical debt to business impact

## Debt Prioritization Framework

**Priority = (Impact Ã— Interest Rate) / Effort**

- **High Priority**: High impact, high interest rate, low effort
- **Medium Priority**: Medium-high impact, medium effort
- **Low Priority**: Low impact or high effort with low interest rate

## Common Debt Patterns

- **Copy-Paste Debt**: Duplicated code â†’ Extract to shared module
- **Hack Debt**: Quick fixes without proper solution â†’ Refactor properly
- **TODO Debt**: Temporary workarounds â†’ Track and schedule fixes
- **Knowledge Debt**: Undocumented complex logic â†’ Add comprehensive docs
- **Infrastructure Debt**: Manual processes â†’ Automate with CI/CD
