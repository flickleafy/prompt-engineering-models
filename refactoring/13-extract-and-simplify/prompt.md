# Analysis Instructions
Identify opportunities for extraction and simplification refactorings:

## 1. **Extract Method**

### When to Extract:
- Methods longer than 20-30 lines
- Methods doing multiple distinct things
- Complex conditional logic that's hard to understand
- Repeated code blocks (even with slight variations)
- Code blocks that need explanatory comments
- Different levels of abstraction mixed together

### Extraction Criteria:
- **Cohesive Functionality**: Extract code that does one clear thing
- **Naming Opportunity**: Can give extracted code a meaningful name
- **Reusability**: Code might be useful elsewhere
- **Testability**: Isolated logic easier to test
- **Clarity**: Extraction improves understanding

### Refactoring Process:
1. Identify cohesive code block
2. Determine required parameters
3. Extract to new method with descriptive name
4. Replace original code with method call
5. Validate behavior unchanged

## 2. **Extract Variable (Introduce Explaining Variable)**

### When to Extract:
- Complex expressions that are hard to read
- Long conditional expressions
- Calculations used multiple times
- Magic numbers or strings
- Intermediate results that need naming

### Benefits:
- Makes code self-documenting
- Reduces duplication
- Facilitates debugging
- Improves testability
- Makes refactoring safer

### Examples of Extractions:
```javascript
// Before
if (order.items.length > 0 && order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0) > 100) {
  // ...
}

// After
const hasItems = order.items.length > 0;
const totalPrice = order.items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
const qualifiesForDiscount = hasItems && totalPrice > 100;

if (qualifiesForDiscount) {
  // ...
}
```

## 3. **Extract Class**

### When to Extract:
- Classes with too many responsibilities (>500 LOC)
- Groups of related methods and data
- Method groups with common parameters
- Cohesive subsets of functionality
- Different rates of change for different features

### Extraction Strategies:
- **By Responsibility**: Extract cohesive business logic
- **By Data Affinity**: Methods operating on same data
- **By Change Reason**: Code that changes together
- **By Abstraction Level**: Separate high/low-level concerns

### Refactoring Steps:
1. Identify cohesive group of methods/fields
2. Create new class with descriptive name
3. Move methods and fields to new class
4. Update original class to use new class
5. Consider composition vs inheritance

## 4. **Extract Interface**

### When to Extract:
- Multiple implementations of similar functionality
- Need to mock dependencies for testing
- Want to reduce coupling
- Client uses subset of class functionality
- Different contexts need different views

### Benefits:
- Enables dependency injection
- Facilitates testing with mocks
- Reduces coupling
- Documents contracts
- Supports polymorphism

## 5. **Extract Superclass/Subclass**

### Extract Superclass When:
- Multiple classes have common behavior
- Duplication across sibling classes
- Need to share implementation

### Extract Subclass When:
- Class used in different ways
- Subset of features used by different clients
- Conditional behavior based on type

## 6. **Decompose Conditional**

### Complex Conditionals to Simplify:
- Long if-else chains
- Nested conditionals (>3 levels)
- Complex boolean expressions
- Switch statements with long cases

### Simplification Techniques:
- Extract condition to well-named method
- Extract each branch to method
- Use guard clauses
- Replace conditional with polymorphism
- Use strategy pattern for complex logic

### Example:
```javascript
// Before
if (date.before(SUMMER_START) || date.after(SUMMER_END)) {
  charge = quantity * winterRate + winterServiceCharge;
} else {
  charge = quantity * summerRate;
}

// After
const charge = isSummer(date) 
  ? summerCharge(quantity)
  : winterCharge(quantity);

function isSummer(date) {
  return !date.before(SUMMER_START) && !date.after(SUMMER_END);
}

function summerCharge(quantity) {
  return quantity * summerRate;
}

function winterCharge(quantity) {
  return quantity * winterRate + winterServiceCharge;
}
```

## 7. **Replace Temp with Query**

### When to Apply:
- Temporary variables calculating values
- Multiple uses of same calculation
- Long methods with many temps
- Temps making extraction harder

### Benefits:
- Enables further extraction
- Eliminates duplication
- Makes code more declarative
- Facilitates testing

## 8. **Split Loop**

### When to Split:
- Loop doing multiple things
- Different concerns mixed in same loop
- Hard to understand what loop does
- Performance acceptable with multiple passes

### After Splitting:
- Each loop does one thing
- Easier to extract loops to methods
- Clearer intent
- Often enables further optimization

## 9. **Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses**

### Pattern:
```javascript
// Before
function getPayAmount() {
  let result;
  if (isDead) {
    result = deadAmount();
  } else {
    if (isSeparated) {
      result = separatedAmount();
    } else {
      if (isRetired) {
        result = retiredAmount();
      } else {
        result = normalPayAmount();
      }
    }
  }
  return result;
}

// After
function getPayAmount() {
  if (isDead) return deadAmount();
  if (isSeparated) return separatedAmount();
  if (isRetired) return retiredAmount();
  return normalPayAmount();
}
```

## 10. **Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments**

### When Same Code in All Branches:
```javascript
// Before
if (isSpecialDeal()) {
  total = price * 0.95;
  send();
} else {
  total = price * 0.98;
  send();
}

// After
if (isSpecialDeal()) {
  total = price * 0.95;
} else {
  total = price * 0.98;
}
send();
```

## 11. **Extract Parameter Object**

### When to Apply:
- Methods with long parameter lists (>3 params)
- Same group of parameters passed together
- Parameters form logical group
- Need to add more related parameters

### Benefits:
- Reduces parameter count
- Groups related data
- Makes intent clearer
- Enables moving behavior to parameter object

# Meta-Prompting Guidelines

<reasoning_effort>
Use HIGH reasoning effort for extraction analysis requiring understanding of code cohesion, appropriate abstraction levels, and optimal naming.
</reasoning_effort>

<self_reflection>
- Create rubric: extraction appropriateness, naming quality, complexity reduction, cohesion improvement, abstraction level appropriateness
- Ensure extractions truly simplify, don't over-abstract
- Verify new names are intuitive and descriptive
- Check that extracted code is genuinely reusable/testable
</self_reflection>

<exploration>
- Analyze code dependencies and data flow
- Identify natural seams for extraction
- Consider multiple extraction strategies
- Evaluate naming options for extracted elements
- Assess impact on overall architecture
</exploration>
```

## Usage Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple extract method refactorings
2. **Name First**: If you can't name it clearly, reconsider extraction
3. **One Thing**: Ensure extracted code does exactly one thing
4. **Test Coverage**: Add tests before extracting complex logic
5. **Incremental**: Extract in small steps, validating each time
6. **Refactor Refactorings**: Sometimes extracted code needs further extraction

## Extraction Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each extracted element does one thing
- **High Cohesion**: Related code extracted together
- **Low Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between extracted elements
- **Clear Intent**: Names reveal purpose without comments
- **Appropriate Abstraction**: Right level of detail for context

## Common Extraction Patterns

1. **Validation Extraction**: Extract validation logic to guard methods
2. **Calculation Extraction**: Extract formulas to named functions
3. **Formatting Extraction**: Extract formatting/display logic
4. **Factory Extraction**: Extract object creation to factory methods
5. **Strategy Extraction**: Extract conditional logic to strategy objects

## When NOT to Extract

- Extraction makes code harder to understand
- Creates unnecessary indirection
- Extracted code too trivial (1-2 lines)
- No clear name for extracted element
- Only used once with no testing benefit
- Breaks natural reading flow

## Measuring Success

- **Reduced Complexity**: Lower cyclomatic complexity per method
- **Shorter Methods**: Average method length < 20 lines
- **Shallow Nesting**: Max nesting depth â‰¤ 3
- **Better Names**: Self-documenting code
- **Easier Testing**: More unit-testable functions
- **Faster Understanding**: New developers grasp code quickly
