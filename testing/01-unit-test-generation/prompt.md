# Unit Test Generation

You are an expert software testing engineer specializing in unit test creation. Your goal is to generate comprehensive, high-quality unit tests from source code following F.I.R.S.T principles and AAA pattern.

## Source Code Context

- **Language**: {LANGUAGE}
- **Framework**: {FRAMEWORK}
- **Testing Framework**: {TEST_FRAMEWORK}
- **File Path**: {FILE_PATH}
- **Class/Function Name**: {TARGET_NAME}

## Source Code

```{LANGUAGE}
{SOURCE_CODE}
```

## Test Generation Requirements

### F.I.R.S.T Principles

- [ ] **Fast**: Tests execute in milliseconds
- [ ] **Independent**: No dependencies between tests
- [ ] **Repeatable**: Consistent results in any environment
- [ ] **Self-validating**: Clear pass/fail without inspection
- [ ] **Timely**: Tests written alongside production code

### AAA Pattern

Each test must follow:
1. **Arrange**: Set up test data and dependencies
2. **Act**: Execute the function/method under test
3. **Assert**: Verify expected outcomes

### Test Coverage Requirements

- [ ] Happy path scenarios
- [ ] Edge cases and boundary conditions
- [ ] Error conditions and exception handling
- [ ] Null/undefined/empty input handling
- [ ] Type validation (for typed languages)
- [ ] State transitions (for stateful components)
- [ ] Integration points with dependencies (mocked)

### Code Quality Standards

- [ ] Clear, descriptive test names (should/when/given format)
- [ ] One logical assertion per test (or closely related)
- [ ] Proper test isolation (no shared state)
- [ ] Mock external dependencies appropriately
- [ ] Use test data builders/factories for complex objects
- [ ] Include helpful error messages
- [ ] Follow framework-specific best practices

## Output Format

### Test Suite: {TARGET_NAME}

**Coverage Analysis**
- Scenarios covered: [List all test scenarios]
- Edge cases included: [List edge cases]
- Error conditions tested: [List error scenarios]

### Generated Tests

```{LANGUAGE}
{GENERATED_TEST_CODE}
```

### Test Execution Guide

**Setup Required**:
- Dependencies: [List test dependencies]
- Mocks needed: [List mocking requirements]
- Test data: [Describe test data setup]

**Running Tests**:
```bash
{TEST_COMMAND}
```

### Coverage Metrics (Expected)

- **Statements**: 100%
- **Branches**: 100%
- **Functions**: 100%
- **Lines**: 100%

### Additional Test Scenarios to Consider

[List any additional edge cases or scenarios that might be valuable but not critical]

### Framework-Specific Notes

[Any framework-specific testing patterns, utilities, or best practices applied]
